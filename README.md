# Microblogging & Knowledge Management

This repository is a starting point for creating a microblogging system. It includes the backend which is strapi running on nodejs.  The front-end is react using a coreui template - https://coreui.io/react/


## Backend
The backend is Strapi, an open-source headless CMS
[https://strapi.io/](https://strapi.io/)

 - I used the Easy Local CLI installation with a template [https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/installation/cli.html](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/installation/cli.html)
